# Coursework – Post Graduate Program in Data Analytics (Purdue University)

## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases the academic course projects I completed as part of the **Post Graduate Program in Data Analytics – Purdue University (Delivered by Simplilearn)**. Each project represents the required subject-level assessments completed throughout the curriculum, demonstrating my understanding of the concepts taught in Python, SQL, R, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and statistical foundations. These projects highlight my ability to apply analytical techniques in a structured academic environment and reflect the progression of skills across each module.

The repository also includes **capstone projects**, which serve as the advanced, domain-focused assessments of the program. These capstones apply multiple concepts from the coursework to solve guided business problems across areas such as marketing, banking, and healthcare.
