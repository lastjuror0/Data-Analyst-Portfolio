## Overview

Marketing Restaurants builds matrices to identify “star” restaurants and power recommendations for a revamped B2C portal using intelligent automation.  
Two datasets support the analysis: the primary restaurant dataset “data” with 19 attributes and a “Country‑Code” lookup with 2 attributes used for country mapping and cross‑market comparison.

## Problem statement

A restaurant consolidator is looking to revamp the B2C portal using intelligent automation tech.  
This requires a different matrix to identify the star restaurants and generate recommendations.  
To make sure an effective model can be achieved, it is important to understand the behavior of the data in hand.

## Week 1 — Importing, Understanding, and Inspecting Data

- Perform preliminary data inspection covering structure, missing values, duplicates, and overall data quality.
- Identify and remove duplicate records based on inspection findings.

## Week 1 — EDA

- Explore the geographical distribution and identify cities with the maximum and minimum number of restaurants.
- Analyze franchising to find the brand with the widest national presence.
- Compute the ratio of restaurants that allow table booking versus those that do not.
- Calculate the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.
- Quantify the difference in vote counts between delivery and non‑delivery restaurants.

---

## Week 2 — EDA

- Identify the top 10 cuisines served across cities.
- Determine the maximum and minimum number of cuisines any single restaurant serves and the most served cuisine per city.
- Examine the distribution of costs across restaurants.
- Study how ratings are distributed among factors such as cuisines, delivery, booking, and price range.
- Explain which factors—number of cuisines, cost, delivery option, table booking, etc.—affect ratings.

---

## Deliverables

- A cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
- EDA report with insights into restaurant ratings and trends.
- A data-driven matrix for identifying and recommending "star" restaurants.
