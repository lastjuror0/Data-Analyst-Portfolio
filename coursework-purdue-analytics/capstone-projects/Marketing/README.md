# Marketing Project

Data Analyst Capstone Project  
Simplilearn | Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur

Overview
Marketing Restaurants builds matrices to identify “star” restaurants and power recommendations for a revamped B2C portal using intelligent automation.
Two datasets support the analysis: the primary restaurant dataset “data” with 19 attributes and a “Country‑Code” lookup with 2 attributes used for country mapping and cross‑market comparisons.

Problem statement
A restaurant consolidator is looking to revamp the B2C portal using intelligent automation tech. 
This requires a different matrix to identify the star restaurants and generate recommendations.
To make sure an effective model can be achieved, it is important to understand the behavior of the data in hand.

Week 1 — Importing, Understanding, and Inspecting Data
