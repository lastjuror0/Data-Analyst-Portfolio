Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of deaths globally. To identify the causes and develop a system to predict potential heart attacks in an effective manner is necessary.

The data presented contains all the information about relevant factors that might have an impact on cardiovascular health. This dataset must be studied in detail for further analysis.

There is one dataset (data) that has 14 attributes with more than 4000 data points.

You are required to determine and examine the factors that play a significant role in increasing the rate of heart attacks. Also, use the findings to create and predict a model.

Dataset Information
Snapshot (Attributes)
age – Age in years

sex – (1 = male; 0 = female)

cp – Type of chest pain

trestbps – Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol – Serum cholesterol in mg/dl

fbs – (Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg – Resting electrocardiographic results

thalach – Maximum heart rate achieved

exang – Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak – ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope – The slope of the peak exercise ST segment

ca – Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy

thal – 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect

target – (1 = heart disease present; 0 = no disease)

Project Tasks
Week 1: Data Understanding and EDA
Importing, Understanding, and Inspecting Data

Perform preliminary data inspection and report findings (data structure, missing values, duplicates, etc.).

Based on the findings, remove duplicates (if any) and treat missing values using an appropriate strategy.

Generate a preliminary statistical summary of the data. Explore the measures of central tendency and spread.

Performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
4. Identify categorical variables and explore them using appropriate tools (e.g., count plots).
5. Study the occurrence of CVD across different ages.
6. Detect whether heart attack risk can be inferred from anomalies in resting blood pressure.
7. Study the gender distribution of patients.

Week 2: Advanced EDA and Modeling
Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and the target variable.

Examine the relationship between peak exercise heart rates (thalach) and the occurrence of heart attack.

Investigate whether thalassemia is a major cause of CVD, and evaluate the impact of other factors.

Use a pair plot to analyze relationships among all variables.

Perform logistic regression, predict outcomes on test data, and validate results using a confusion matrix.

Dashboarding (Visualization in Tableau)
6. Visualize variables to compare attributes of diseased vs. healthy individuals.
7. Build a dashboard to demonstrate variable associations and key contributing factors.

Deliverables
A cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

EDA insights identifying significant risk factors.

Logistic regression model for prediction.

Tableau dashboard showcasing insights into CVD occurrences.
