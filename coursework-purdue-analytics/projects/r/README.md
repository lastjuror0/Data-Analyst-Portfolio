course-end project  
Simplilearn | Purdue University

---

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the data to understand the environmental and seasonal settings
- Predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings with the help of a machine learning algorithm

---

## Prerequisites

- Exploratory data analysis
- Data manipulation
- Data visualization
- R programming
- Machine learning

---

## Industry Relevance

- Exploratory data analysis: It finds trends and patterns, or checks assumptions by analyzing data with visual tools
- Data manipulation: It organizes and changes information to make it more understandable
- Data visualization: It represents data with the use of common graphs, plots, or charts
- R programming: It is used for statistical analysis, graphics representation, and reporting
- Machine Learning: It helps software programs in being more accurate at predicting outcomes without explicitly programming them to do so

## Problem Statement

In bike-sharing systems, the entire process from membership to rental and return has been automated. Using these systems, users can easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another. Hence, the system needs to predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings.

## Dataset Information

- 'instant' – Record index

- 'dteday' – Date

- 'season' – Season (1: springer, 2: summer, 3: fall, 4: winter)

- 'yr' – Year (0: 2011, 1: 2012)

- 'mnth' – Month (1 to 12)

- 'holiday' – Weather day is a holiday or not

- 'weekday' – Day of the week

- 'workingday' – Working day (1: neither weekend nor holiday, 0: other days)

- 'weathersit' – Weather situation (1: Clear, few clouds, partly cloudy, 2: Mist + cloudy, mist + broken clouds, mist + few clouds, mist, 3: Light snow, light rain + thunderstorm + scattered clouds, light rain + scattered clouds, 4: Heavy rain + ice pallets)

- 'temp' – Normalized temperature in Celsius; values divided into 41 (max)

- 'atemp' – Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius; values divided into 50 (max)

- 'hum' – Normalized humidity; values divided into 100 (max)

- 'windspeed' – Normalized wind speed; values divided into 67 (max)

- 'casual' – Count of casual users

- 'registered' – Count of registered users

- 'cnt' – Count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered

## Tasks to Perform

### Perform the following tasks on the dataset provided using R:

- Load the dataset and the relevant libraries
- Perform data type conversion of the attributes
- Carry out the missing value analysis
- Attributes distribution and trends
- Plot monthly distribution of the total number of bikes rented
- Plot yearly distribution of the total number of bikes rented
- Plot boxplot for outliers' analysis
- Split the dataset into train and test dataset
- Create a model using the random forest algorithm
- Predict the performance of the model on the test dataset

## Project Outcome

This project is designed to help understand how to perform exploratory data analysis, plot graphs, and predict using a machine learning algorithm.

You should be able to analyze the dataset for this project to create a report. You will be able to use a machine learning algorithm and predict the bikes rented daily.
