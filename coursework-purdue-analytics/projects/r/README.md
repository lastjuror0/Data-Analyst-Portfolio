course-end project  
Simplilearn | Purdue University

---

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the data to understand the environmental and seasonal settings
- Predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings with the help of a machine learning algorithm

---

## Prerequisites

- Exploratory data analysis
- Data manipulation
- Data visualization
- R programming
- Machine learning

---

## Industry Relevance

- Exploratory data analysis: It finds trends and patterns, or checks assumptions by analyzing data with visual tools
- Data manipulation: It organizes and changes information to make it more understandable
- Data visualization: It represents data with the use of common graphs, plots, or charts
- R programming: It is used for statistical analysis, graphics representation, and reporting
- Machine Learning: It helps software programs in being more accurate at predicting outcomes without explicitly programming them to do so

## Problem Statement

In bike-sharing systems, the entire process from membership to rental and return has been automated. Using these systems, users can easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another. Hence, the system needs to predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings.

## Tasks to Perform

### Perform the following tasks on the dataset provided using R:

- Load the dataset and the relevant libraries
- Perform data type conversion of the attributes
- Carry out the missing value analysis
- Attributes distribution and trends
- Plot monthly distribution of the total number of bikes rented
- Plot yearly distribution of the total number of bikes rented
- Plot boxplot for outliers' analysis
- Split the dataset into train and test dataset
- Create a model using the random forest algorithm
- Predict the performance of the model on the test dataset

## Project Outcome

This project is designed to help understand how to perform exploratory data analysis, plot graphs, and predict using a machine learning algorithm.

You should be able to analyze the dataset for this project to create a report. You will be able to use a machine learning algorithm and predict the bikes rented daily.
