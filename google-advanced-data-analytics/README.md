# Coursework – Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains coursework and projects completed as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.

The program is structured as a sequence of applied courses that progressively build skills in data analysis, statistics, machine learning, and analytical communication using Python. The projects in this repository represent the required end-of-course assessments completed throughout the program and demonstrate applied understanding of analytical concepts within a guided, coursework-based setting.

The repository also includes a **capstone project**, which serves as the culminating assessment of the program and applies multiple concepts to a realistic, end-to-end analytical problem.

## 🏁 Capstone Project

### **Employee Retention Analysis**

The capstone project is the culminating assessment of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate** and integrates skills developed across all prior courses into a single, end-to-end analytics project.

The project is based on a fictional workplace scenario and focuses on analyzing employee survey data to support Human Resources decision-making.

The work includes:
- Preparing and exploring the dataset
- Building and evaluating a predictive model  
  (regression or tree-based machine learning) to estimate employee attrition
- Creating data visualizations relevant to the analytical question
- Interpreting model results and considering ethical implications
- Communicating findings through a concise executive summary

The capstone produces two primary artifacts:
- A complete analysis notebook
- A one-page summary intended for non-technical stakeholders
