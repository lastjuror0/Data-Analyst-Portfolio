# Automatidata – Machine Learning Modeling (Course 6)

## Context
This folder contains an end-of-course project for **Course 6: The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning** in the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.

The project continues the fictional Automatidata consulting scenario and focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model using Python.

## What This Project Covers
This project focuses on **machine learning model development and evaluation**, rather than regression-only modeling or exploratory analysis.

It demonstrates:
- Preparing features for machine learning
- Designing and implementing a machine learning model
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics
- Interpreting model results in an analytical context
- Summarizing findings for non-technical stakeholders

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook** containing feature engineering, model development, and evaluation
- **Executive Summary** summarizing results and key insights

## Notes
- This is a **course-based project**
- The scenario, organizations, names, and data references are fictional
- The dataset is created for pedagogical purposes
- Original course materials are not included
