- Building a dataframe from a provided dataset
- Inspecting and summarizing column data types
- Gathering basic descriptive statistics
- Organizing data in preparation for exploratory data analysis
- Answering structured questions in a guided Jupyter notebook
- Communicating progress and observations through an executive summary

## Deliverables
- **PACE Strategy Responses** related to Course 2 tasks
- **Jupyter Notebook** containing dataframe creation, data inspection, and preparation steps
- **Executive Summary** communicating key observations and progress

## Notes
- This is a **course-based project**
- The scenario, organizations, names, and data references are fictional
- The dataset is created for pedagogical purposes
- Original course materials are not included
