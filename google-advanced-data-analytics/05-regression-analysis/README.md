# Automatidata – Regression Modeling (Course 5)

## Context
This folder contains an end-of-course project for **Course 5: Regression Analysis – Simplify Complex Data Relationships** in the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.

The project continues the fictional Automatidata consulting scenario and focuses on building and evaluating regression models using Python.

## What This Project Covers
This project focuses on **regression modeling**, rather than exploratory analysis or statistical testing alone.

It demonstrates:
- Determining an appropriate regression approach for the problem
- Building a regression model using Python
- Checking and validating model assumptions
- Evaluating model performance
- Interpreting regression results in an analytical context
- Summarizing findings for non-technical stakeholders

## Deliverables
- **PACE Strategy Document** outlining planning considerations for modeling
- **Jupyter Notebook** containing regression model development and evaluation
- **Executive Summary** reporting results and key interpretations

## Notes
- This is a **course-based project**
- The scenario, organizations, names, and data references are fictional
- The dataset is altered for pedagogical purposes
- Original course materials are not included
