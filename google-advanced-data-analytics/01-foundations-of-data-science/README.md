# Automatidata – PACE Project Planning (Course 1)

## Context
This folder contains my end-of-course project for **Course 1: Foundations of Data Science** in the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**.

The project uses a fictional consulting scenario (Automatidata) to practice structuring an analytics project before analysis begins.

## What This Project Covers
This project focuses on **project planning**, not data analysis or modeling.

Specifically, it demonstrates:
- Organizing analytics tasks into milestones
- Classifying tasks using the **PACE framework (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute)**
- Documenting project structure in a proposal format

## Deliverables
- **PACE Strategy Document** – task classification and planning using the PACE workflow
- **Project Proposal** – milestone-based outline of the planned analytics work

## Notes
- This is a **course-based planning exercise**
- All organizations, names, and data references are fictional
- Original course materials and datasets are not included
