ðŸ“š Book Clustering with SQL + Python

Tech Stack: Python, SQL (DuckDB), Pandas, scikit-learn, Tableau, Selenium (Chrome WebDriver)

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project performs end-to-end book dataset collection, analysis, and clustering to group similar books together based on ratings, reviews, and publication details.
It begins with a Selenium-based Goodreads scraper (cookie-persisted login, headless, deduped link sets), then combines SQL-centric processing in DuckDB with Python modeling to deliver clear insights and actionable groupings.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Collect book data via a Selenium scraper with saved login cookies.

Clean & Structure Data efficiently using SQL in DuckDB inside Jupyter.

Explore patterns in book ratings, publication trends, and review counts.

Engineer features that capture book popularity and quality.

Cluster similar books using machine learning.

Visualize results in Python and Tableau for clear interpretation.
